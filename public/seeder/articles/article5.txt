<h3>What is Network Security?: Why Is Network Security Important?</h3>
<p>
    Our world has been converted to digitization, resulting in modifications in nearly all our daily activities. All
    organizations want to protect their networks if the intention is to deliver the services demanded using employees
    and customers. Network security ultimately protects the recognition of your organization. With hackers increasing
    and becoming smarter day by day, the need to utilize network security tools becomes more and more impotent.

<h4>Here are the 14 Types of Network Security Protections
    Antivirus and Antimalware Software:</h4>

<p>
    This software is used for protecting against malware, which includes spyware, ransomware, Trojans, worms, and
    viruses. Malware can also become very dangerous as it can infect a network and then remain calm for days or even
    weeks. This software handles this threat by scanning for malware entry and regularly tracks files afterward to
    detect anomalies, remove malware, and fix the damage.
</p>

<h4>Application Security:</h4>
<p>
    It is essential to have application security since no app is created perfectly. Any application can comprise
    vulnerabilities or holes that attackers use to enter your network. Application security thus encompasses the
    software, hardware, and processes you select for closing those holes.
</p>

<h4>Behavioral Analytics:</h4>
<p>
    To detect abnormal network behavior, you will have to know what normal behavior looks like. Behavioral analytics
    tools can automatically discern activities that deviate from the norm. Your network security team will thus be able
    to efficiently detect indicators of compromise that pose a potential problem and rapidly remediate threats.
</p>

<h4>
    Data Loss Prevention (DLP):
</h4>

<p>
    Organizations should guarantee that their staff does not send sensitive information outside the network. They should
    thus use DLP technologies, network security measures that prevent people from uploading, forwarding, or even
    printing vital information in an unsafe manner.
</p>

<h4>
    Email Security:
</h4>

<p>
    Email gateways are considered the number one threat vector for a security breach. Attackers use social engineering
    tactics and personal information to build refined phishing campaigns to deceive recipients and then send them to
    sites serving up malware. An email security application can block incoming attacks and control outbound messages to
    prevent the loss of sensitive data.
</p>

<h4>
    Firewalls:
</h4>

<p>
    Firewalls place a barrier between your trusted internal network and untrusted outside networks, like the Internet. A
    set of defined rules are employed to block or allow traffic. A firewall can be software, hardware, or both. The free
    firewall efficiently manages traffic on your PC, monitors in/out connections, and secures all connections when you
    are online.
</p>

<h4>
    Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):
</h4>

<p>
    An IPS is network security capable of actively scanning network traffic to block attacks. The IPS Setting interface
    permits the administrator to configure the ruleset updates for Snort. It is possible to schedule the ruleset updates
    allowing them to run at particular intervals automatically, and these updates can be run manually on demand.
</p>

<h4>
    Mobile Device Network Security:
</h4>

<p>
    Mobile devices and apps are increasingly being targeted by cybercriminals. 90% of IT organizations could soon
    support corporate applications on personal mobile devices. You indeed have to control which devices can access your
    network. It is also necessary to configure their connections to keep network traffic private.
</p>

<h4>
    Network Segmentation:
</h4>

<p>
    Software-defined segmentation places network traffic into varied classifications and makes enforcing security
    policies a lot easier. The categories are ideally based on endpoint identity, not just IP addresses. Rights can be
    accessed based on location, role, and more so that the right people get the correct level of access and suspicious
    devices are thus contained and remediated.
</p>


<h4>
    Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):
</h4>

<p>
    SIEM products bring together all the information needed by your network security staff to identify and respond to
    threats. These products are available in different forms, including virtual and physical appliances and server
    software.
</p>

<h4>
    Virtual Private Network (VPN):
</h4>

<p>
    A VPN is another type of network security capable of encrypting the connection from an endpoint to a network, mainly
    over the Internet. A Remote VPN Access typically uses IPsec or Secure Sockets Layer to authenticate the
    communication between web and device.
</p>

<h4>
    Web Security:
</h4>

<p>
    A perfect web security solution will help in controlling your staffâ€™s web use, denying access to malicious websites,
    and blocking.
</p>

<h4>
    Wireless Security:
</h4>
<p>
    The mobile office movement is gaining momentum along with wireless networks and access points. However, wireless
    networks are not as secure as wired ones, which makes way for hackers to enter. It is thus essential for wireless
    security to be strong. It should be noted that without stringent security measures installing a wireless LAN could
    be like placing Ethernet ports everywhere. Products specifically designed for protecting a wireless network will
    have to be used to prevent an exploit from taking place.
</p>

<h4>
    Endpoint Security:
</h4>
<p>
    Endpoint Security, also known as Network Protection or Network Security, is a methodology used for protecting
    corporate networks when accessed through remote devices such as laptops or several other wireless devices and mobile
    devices. For instance, Xcitium Advanced Endpoint Protection software presents seven defense layers: virus scope,
    file reputation, auto-sandbox, host intrusion prevention, web URL filtering, firewall, and antivirus software. All
    this is offered under a single offering to protect them from both unknown and known threats.
</p>

<h4>
    Network Access Control (NAC):
</h4>

<p>
    This network security process helps you control who can access your network. It is essential to recognize each
    device and user to keep out potential attackers. This, indeed, will help you to enforce your security policies.
    Noncompliant endpoint devices can be given only limited access or just blocked.
